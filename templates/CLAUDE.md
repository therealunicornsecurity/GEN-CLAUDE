# Claude Code Workspace — {{TOOL_NAME}}

> RULES.md is law. Read it before any work. No exceptions.
> Local rule additions go in `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` (not synced, not committed).

## File Ownership Tiers (RULES.md §10)

Every file in this repo is exactly one tier:

| Tier | Label       | `GEN-CLAUDE.sh update` behavior                |
|------|-------------|-----------------------------------------|
| 1    | Law         | Force-sync from remote — local edits lost |
| 2    | Scaffold    | Written at init only — never overwritten |
| 3    | Merge       | Added if missing — kept if present       |
| 4    | Local       | Never touched                           |

Rules cannot be overwritten by local edits. Edit `RULES.md` in the kit meta-repo,
or add overrides to `.claude/CLAUDE.local.md` (Tier 4).

## Claude-Specific Rules
1. NEVER run commands outside this repo without explicit permission (RULES.md §5)
