# Changelog

All notable changes to GEN-CLAUDE are recorded here. Format follows the kit's own VERSIONING.md.

## [1.4.0-Andromeda] - 2026-08-31
### Added
- **Interface Contracts system** (`RULES.md` §11, new; ported from the 0.1.1-Orion side-cut): a repo declares each external file/language/structure surface an ingestor depends on under `docs/contracts/<repo>/<contract>/` (a `contract.yml` manifest + version-tagged, sanitized samples); the kit hosts/indexes aggregated contracts (`contracts/` + `registry.json`) but never invents a repo's contracts. Agent-executed `/check_contracts` (validate + gate) and `/export_contracts` (publish upstream). §2 and the §3 DOC step gained contract-currency clauses. Ships the `contract.yml` scaffold (Tier-2), the empty `contracts/` store, and a `/contracts` skill.
- **`/doc_alignment`** command — gated doc↔code alignment sweep.
- **`/supply_chain_audit`** skill — dependency malware / supply-chain check against a known-malware/advisory database, gated as Procedure B Step 0.
- **`/backup_chat`, `/restore_chat`** commands — snapshot/restore the Claude Code session to `.claude/sessions/`.
- **`security_auditor`** agent — isolated §5 security audit, pairs with the `/security_scan` skill.
- `GEN-CLAUDE.sh` and `GEN-CLAUDE.ps1` `SYNC_MANIFEST` (+8 entries each) and `init` scaffold (`docs/contracts/`) updated to distribute all of the above; `.claude/docs/index.md`, `docs/index.md`, `README.md` inventories refreshed; `spec_writer` agent reports to "the operator".

## [1.3.0-Andromeda] - 2026-08-31
### Added
- **Two binding AI-conduct rules** in `RULES.md` §8 (AI Assistant Rules), ported from the 0.1.1-Orion side-cut: **16. Answer concise and verified** (lead with the answer, shortest response that covers the ask, response over-engineering banned as code over-engineering is, never assert the unverified) and **17. Clarify before substantial work** (before substantial new code or a non-trivial fix, ask the operator numbered per-section questions and wait). §3's SPEC step gained an in-flow pointer to rule 17. Applied to both `templates/RULES.md` (source of truth) and the kit-self `RULES.md`.

## [1.2.1-Andromeda] - 2026-07-05
### Changed
- **Rebranded EDI → GEN-CLAUDE** across all live files (README banner/wordmark, RULES, CLAUDE.md, docs, skills, templates, hooks, and the boundary env var `GEN_CLAUDE_BOUNDARY_EXTRA`). GitHub repo → `GEN-CLAUDE` via `gh repo rename`. Dated release-history entries kept accurate.

## [1.2.0-Andromeda] - 2026-07-05
### Changed
- **Renamed the scaffolder** `edi.sh` → `GEN-CLAUDE.sh` and `edi.ps1` → `GEN-CLAUDE.ps1`; all references updated across the repo (release history preserved).
- **Security Step 6 now delegates to the official bundled `/security-review`** (Anthropic) — run in addition to `/security_scan`. `/security_review` became a thin wrapper, not a reimplementation.
### Verified
- No official Anthropic unit-test-generation skill exists (only `webapp-testing`, E2E-scoped); `/test_gen` left unchanged.

## [1.1.0-Andromeda] - 2026-06-09
### Added
- `/security_review` skill — AI-powered, diff-scoped semantic security review (severity + confidence scoring, false-positive filtering). Integrates [anthropics/claude-code-security-review](https://github.com/anthropics/claude-code-security-review) (MIT) and complements the grep-based `/security_scan`.
- `templates/security-review.yml` — opt-in CI workflow (the upstream GitHub Action), synced to `.github/workflows/security-review.yml` (Tier 3, merge-if-missing). Both new files added to the `edi.sh` and `edi.ps1` sync manifests.
### Changed
- **Procedure B Step 6 (SECURITY) now runs BOTH passes** — `/security_scan` (grep §5) and `/security_review` (AI diff review); both blocking. Updated `RULES.md`, `templates/RULES.md`, `procedure_b.md`, `Makefile`, `templates/Makefile`, the CLAUDE skills tables, and both doc indexes.

## [1.0.1-Andromeda] - 2026-06-08
### Added
- `edi.ps1` — PowerShell 7 port of the `edi.sh` scaffolder (full `init`/`update`/`comply`/`help` parity, identical 26-entry sync manifest).

## [1.0.0-Andromeda] - 2026-06-08
### Changed
- **BREAKING:** renamed the scaffolder `kit.sh` → `edi.sh`; all references updated across the repo (`SYNC_MANIFEST`, commands, skills, docs, RULES).
- Hardened `/tag`: the step-7 output is the git command block only — no co-author / AI / sign-off trailers — with a worked example embedded in the command.
- Rewrote and rebranded the README and the kit to EDI (Enhanced Defense Intelligence).
### Added
- `configs/codenames.yml` bootstrapped from `templates/codenames-example.yml`; `Orion` (0.1.0) marked consumed and `Andromeda` assigned to 1.0.0.

## [0.1.0-Orion] - 2026-05-25
### Added
- Initial publishable cut. Workspace kit for general coding teams using Claude Code: `templates/RULES.md` (the law file, 10 sections), `edi.sh` scaffolder, per-language `.gitignore` templates, universal `Makefile`, `VERSIONING.md` (`MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH[-CODENAME]` scheme), `codenames-example.yml` (constellations starter pool), `decisions/DECISIONS.md` (decision log template).
- `.claude/` workspace: `CLAUDE.md`, five slash commands (`tag`, `freeze`, `new_tool`, `procedure_a`, `procedure_b`), six skills (`commit_format`, `review`, `refactor`, `test_gen`, `perf_benchmark`, `deps_audit`), three agents (`spec_writer`, `test_writer`, `code_reviewer`), `module_spec.md` template, `.claude/docs/index.md`.
- Four-tier file ownership system (Law / Scaffold / Merge / Local) so `edi.sh update` can re-sync rule changes without clobbering user code.
- Two binding procedures: TDD (`/procedure_a`, 8 steps) and Code Quality Review (`/procedure_b`, 9 steps incl. deps audit gate).
